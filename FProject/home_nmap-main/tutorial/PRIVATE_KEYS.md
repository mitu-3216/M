# GitGuardian complains about private keys being exposed. I'm aware

I created these keys for the tutorial, and I put the WHOLE set (private/ public keys) on purpose here. I do not use these keys on my home network nor anywhere else.

You should create your own set, these were provided for demonstration purposes. Use common sense.
